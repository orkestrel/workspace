Use only the centralized files an environment needs.

## Declaration placement

- An implementation file contains imports and exactly one class implementation with `#` fields.
- It contains no module-scope interface, type, constant, or free function—even when private to that file.
- A function module contains imports and exactly one exported function named for its file. Everything else extracts by kind exactly as it does from a class module.
- Extract local declarations by kind. “Only used here” and “not exported” are not exemptions.
- Every declaration in a centralized file is exported. Fold away a trivial single-use declaration or export/test it; never leave it hidden.
- The only permitted non-exported module-scope declarations are in a runtime entrypoint that must be self-contained and cannot import siblings, such as raw source loaded in a worker. Explain that necessity in a comment.
- Perform a cleanup sweep after implementation: no stray implementation-file declarations, non-exported/wrong-kind centralized declarations, prohibited nested declarations, duplicate implementations, compatibility aliases, superfluous wrappers, stale imports/barrel rows, or untested extracted functions.

## Kind purity

- Each centralized file contains only its named kind.
- Module-scope constants live only in `constants.ts`, use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, and freeze object/array data with `Object.freeze`.
- A camelCase namespace containing functions is helper behavior, not constant data; place it in `helpers.ts`.
- `helpers.ts` is exported reusable infrastructure. A reusable regex, parser, header flattener, signer, or similar fragment has one implementation used by source, tests, and fixtures.
- A would-be helper has two outcomes:
  - trivial and genuinely single-use → fold into its caller;
  - non-trivial or reusable → extract, export, unit-test, and route every duplicate through it.
- `factories.ts`, `compilers.ts`, and `parsers.ts` are centralized files, not hiding places. Factory glue extracts to `helpers.ts`; pure compiler/parser recursion remains exported in its own kind file.

## Wrapper test

A wrapper survives only when it adds a real boundary, invariant, composition, translation, lifecycle, or materially narrower contract.

- Delete one-line delegates, pass-through factories, rename-only helpers/getters, compatibility aliases, and wrappers around semantically identical platform or declared-dependency primitives.
- Rename or import the real symbol and update every consumer atomically. Do not preserve a wrapper to avoid downstream edits.
- Do not re-export a dependency's symbol from this package.
- A public class method composes real entity behavior; it never exists only to forward 1:1 to a helper.
- Audit callers and callees after every extraction so the old path and duplicate implementation do not remain.

## Functions and orchestration

- Never declare or assign a function inside another function or method.
- This bans local `function`, `function*`, and `const fn = () => ...`, regardless of caller count.
- The only in-body function expressions allowed are an anonymous callback passed directly as an argument and an anonymous function returned directly as the result (the factory/combinator pattern).
- Instance-bound work that reaches state or sibling methods is a method, not a free function.

Separate three roles:

1. **Public method:** implements the interface and genuinely composes behavior; never forwards 1:1 to one helper.
2. **`#` private method:** stateful/instance-bound orchestration or the class's defining recursive/compositional algorithm.
3. **Centralized helper:** pure referentially transparent leaf, independently understandable/testable without class knowledge.

Apply the leaf test:

1. Reaches `#` state or a sibling method → private method.
2. Pure self-contained computation (key, format, compare, convert, lookup, projection, one unification) → exported helper.
3. Recursive spine or composition of leaves (`solve`, `isolate`, `prove`, chaining, relational join), even if pure → private method.
4. Defining engine internals remain methods when extraction would hollow the class into a thin delegate.

Extract pure leaves aggressively; keep the class's actual behavior.

## Class order

1. `#` private fields: context, options, state/result, child managers.
2. Constructor: initialize context/options and instantiate child managers.
3. Public interface: getters, then methods.
4. `#` private methods.

Store child managers in `#` fields and expose readonly getters typed as their interfaces.

## Middleware

- Middleware is behavior `(context, next) => ...`, never a class with one `handle` method.
- Place middleware factories in `middlewares.ts` as `createX(options): Middleware`; keep them distinct from entity/value factories.
- Keep middleware-local state closure-private.
- If consumers must address, share, inspect, or replace that state, extract the state to a pluggable class supplied as an option, with an in-memory default.
- Extract reusable cross-middleware machinery to helpers/classes.
- `MiddlewareManager` is the sole manager of the middleware composition chain; do not create one manager per middleware.

## Environment/module placement

- Shared cross-environment logic belongs in the central core/shared layer. Other environments import core; core imports neither browser nor server.
- An environment with multiple modules keeps cross-module types/helpers at the environment root and module-specific declarations inside the module.
- Promote a declaration to the environment root only when at least two modules use it.
- The environment barrel re-exports root files and module barrels.
- Cover cross-cutting environment-root helpers with behavioral tests; each module API receives its own guide parity.

### Entity subfolders

- When one entity grows a family (entity + manager or sibling implementations), nest only its class files in a lowercase plural folder.
- Keep its interfaces in module-root `types.ts`, factories in module-root `factories.ts`, and exports in the module barrel.
- Entity subfolders never grow their own centralized files.

### Kind or folder

- A word is either a centralized kind or a domain folder, never both.
- A folder named for a centralized kind—`helpers/`, `validators/`, `handlers/`—is that kind's file, not a folder.
- A function domain is designated in the fleet-canon register (`tests/setupPolicy.ts`,
  `FUNCTION_DOMAIN_FOLDERS`), not inferred from a folder's name: a camelCase module inside an
  undesignated folder is misplaced. A workspace requests a new domain through a fleet-canon change;
  there is no workspace-local registration path.

### Extension categories

- A designed extension point—drivers, stores, transports—gets its category folder even with one concrete class.
- This applies both to consumer implementations of another domain's contract and default implementations beside the defining contract.
- The contract remains in module-root `types.ts`; only concrete classes nest.
- Nest because the category is a designed growth seam, not because a class name happens to end in `Store` or `Driver`.
- Co-equal native-object wrappers that are core primitives stay flat.

### Stores

Choose the access shape:

- **Point access:** `get`, `set`, `delete`.
- **Bulk restore:** `save`, `load`, `remove`, `clear`.

Both obey:

- The stored value carries its own id; do not pass a separate id to `set`/`save`.
- Every primitive is async and returns a `Promise`.
- Deleting/removing a missing key is a no-op.
- Concrete stores live in `stores/`; the interface stays in module-root `types.ts`; `create*Store` factories stay in `factories.ts`.

## Barrel exports

- `*/index.ts` is the sole public barrel.
- Only an `index.ts` may re-export.
- A barrel contains only `export * from './module.js'` declarations. Do not use
  named, default, namespace, or type-only barrel exports.
- A star-export collision is a design failure: rename the conflicting concept
  at its owner and update consumers. Never hide the collision with a selective
  barrel row.
- Never re-export a symbol originating in another package; fix consumer imports to the originating package.
- Implementation files export their own classes directly.
- Every intentional top-level source export is public through its correct environment barrel. Current
  consumer count never gates later exposure: developers receive the same supported mechanisms the
  package uses for full control and customization. If a declaration should not be public, make it a
  true local/runtime-private detail or remove the capability for a substantive reason; do not leave
  an intentional reusable export stranded outside the barrel.
- When a symbol moves, update every import; never leave a compatibility re-export.

```ts
export * from './types.js'
export * from './constants.js'
export * from './errors.js'
export * from './validators.js'
export * from './helpers.js'
export * from './factories.js'
export * from './greeters/Greeter.js'
```

## System constraints

- Build or substantively expand a capability with its first real consumer; do not speculate. This
  gate applies only when creating or expanding the capability, not to its later barrel exposure.
- Keep interfaces to the smallest primitives the capability requires.
- For multiple backends, implement shared querying/paging/aggregation in one engine over those primitives. A backend may override an operation only with a genuine native fast path and otherwise falls back to the engine.
- Centralize any pattern repeated twice.
- Keep everything generic/reusable and free of unrelated-project logic.
- Do not expand the capability set without concrete need. Once that capability exists intentionally,
  its reusable top-level exports follow the barrel rule above without a second consumer gate.
- Do not remove structural files because they are currently empty.
- Prefer the smallest complete implementation that preserves architecture.
- No deprecation aliases, compatibility shims, or backward-compatibility branches; update all consumers atomically.
- No polling/busy loops or recursive microtasks as architecture. Park idle work on an event/abort wakeup and yield long work in cooperative quanta.
- Framework/server utilities provide mechanism—HMAC, CORS, parsing, sessions, cookies, CSRF, static serving—not product policy such as user models, login flow, or authorization.
