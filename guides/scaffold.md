# Scaffold

> Scaffold compiles a workspace specification into an ordered list of files, compares that list to a
> real directory, and writes the difference. It ships one executable, `scaffold`, and two library
> entry points: `@orkestrel/scaffold` is the pure compiler and its data contracts, and
> `@orkestrel/scaffold/server` is the filesystem writer and the network reader. Source:
> [`src/core/index.ts`](../src/core/index.ts) and [`src/server/index.ts`](../src/server/index.ts).

The package exists because every `@orkestrel` repository shares the same toolchain, the same agent
instructions, and the same root dotfiles. Keeping thirty copies of those files in agreement by hand
does not work. Scaffold makes the shared set data — a vendored data root shipped inside the package
— and gives it three verbs: create a workspace from it, report how a workspace differs from it, and
write the difference back.

Every code fence below is illustrative. Nothing runs one, so a trailing `// value` comment inside a
fence is this guide's claim rather than a measured answer; the driven examples are the ones the
shipped declarations print. Limits states what that leaves unproven and what covers it instead.

```sh
npm install --save-dev @orkestrel/scaffold
```

The executable needs Node 22.12 or newer. Run it through `npx` without installing:

```sh
npx @orkestrel/scaffold --help
```

## Methods

`Compiler` implements `CompilerInterface`, `Materializer` implements `MaterializerInterface`, and
`Upstream` implements `UpstreamInterface`. Each class exposes exactly its interface's members and
nothing more, so the interface tables below describe the classes too. `WriteTransaction` publishes
no interface and is documented directly.

## Command line

Five verbs. Authority is the verb's: every verb except `audit` writes when it is typed, and no
option grants a write.

| Verb        | Writes                                                                            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `new`       | A whole workspace, into a target that holds nothing the plan would collide with   |
| `audit`     | Nothing                                                                           |
| `repair`    | Each planned path the target is missing or has let drift                          |
| `catalog`   | The package table and the guide mirrors                                           |
| `overwrite` | Everything `repair` and `catalog` write, plus deletions and the dependency ranges |

`scaffold --help` prints the whole reference:

exit codes
  0  clean
  1  drift or failure
  2  usage error
```

An option a verb does not list is refused by name rather than parsed and ignored. `--deps` reaches
the registry, so `new` fails when the registry names no release for a package it was given: the
workspace would otherwise declare a dependency that does not resolve.

`new --bin` creates the executable entry, its test, and its scoped Vite and TypeScript wrappers. The
other structural facts do not need creation flags. Add `tests/guides.test.ts` for `guides`,
`tests/distribution.test.ts` for `distribution`, `tests/integration.test.ts` for `integration`,
`tests/conformance.test.ts` for `conformance`, `tests/setupService.ts` for `service`,
`tests/setupGlobal.ts` for `global`, and `configs/app/vite.showcase.config.ts` for `showcase`;
reading verbs detect each exact-case file and register its fixed machinery. Add `scripts/service.sh`
for `vendors`. Reading verbs preserve and protect that birth-owned script, but do not infer its
vendor list from edited text.

### Reading a target

`audit`, `repair`, `catalog`, and `overwrite` derive the blueprint from the target itself. The name
and the declared `@orkestrel/*` packages come from `package.json`. The two environment axes come
from the directories the target actually ships, because a directory is the fact and a declaration
beside it could disagree. Eight more facts come from exact-case files: `src/bin/main.ts` selects
`bin`, `tests/guides.test.ts` selects `guides`, `tests/distribution.test.ts` selects `distribution`,
`tests/integration.test.ts` selects `integration`, `tests/conformance.test.ts` selects
`conformance`, `tests/setupService.ts` selects `service`, `tests/setupGlobal.ts` selects `global`,
and `configs/app/vite.showcase.config.ts` selects `showcase`. A containing directory does not select
the fact by itself.

`vendors` is not reconstructed. Its only artifact, `scripts/service.sh`, is birth-owned, so edited
script text is not a trustworthy declaration of a vendor list. A present script remains in the
target and remains protected from deletion through the owned scripts inventory, but a reading verb
does not infer vendors from it.

That is why the live-service project follows `service` rather than `vendors`. A reading verb has to
plan the project before it can say anything about a target that runs one, and a vendor list it
cannot recover would leave every such workspace unplannable. `tests/setupService.ts` is recoverable,
is the module the root configuration names by path, and is what a live proof needs anyway, so it
carries the fact and the vendor list keeps its own separate job.

The root Vite configuration defines and registers the fixed `guides` project only when the derived
blueprint carries `guides`. Reading verbs set that fact only when `tests/guides.test.ts` is a
physical file with that exact path case. A directory or a case-folded spelling does not select it. A
fresh workspace therefore carries no guides project or script. A developer who adds the proof must
also add the exact `test:guides` script line that the plan reports; the manifest remains
birth-owned.

The three plan-reading verbs compare the Vitest project set named by the target manifest with the
project set the planned root configuration registers. Every planned proof project must also be
reachable from the manifest's `test` chain. A target whose manifest does not set `private: true` may
also reach it from `prepublishOnly`. A private target cannot use that chain, because npm refuses the
package before a publish lifecycle script runs, so crediting it would report a dead gate as a live
one. Generated integration runs from `test`. One shell-token pass reads quoted and unquoted
`--project value` and `--project=value` forms and follows literal `npm run` calls. A shell expansion
or malformed quote that prevents a project or script name from being resolved statically produces a
question instead of licensing a write. The classifier is deliberately bounded to manifest script
text that names `vitest`; an external wrapper whose name does not identify its runner supplies no
static Vitest fact to infer.

`audit` still completes the comparison and reports one non-blocking `projects` question. For a
literal absent project, its advisory tells the developer to register the project or remove the
script. For a planned project absent from both gate chains, the advisory gives the exact direct
script line to add to `package.json`. `repair` and `overwrite` refuse either mismatch and do not
write the manifest or configuration. Their absent-project refusal tells the developer to remove the
script or not use scaffold writing verbs for a workspace that needs custom Vitest projects. It does
not recommend editing the content-owned configuration that the refusing verb would restore. An
advisory alone does not make an aligned target drift.

The same three plan-reading verbs compare the tooling set the derived blueprint plans against
`dependencies` and `devDependencies` together. A missing planned package produces one non-blocking
`dependencies` question naming every missing package and the exact manifest lines to add, in stable
order. The comparison measures membership only: range differences and workspace-owned extras are
outside it, and a planned tool may live in either section. A present section that is not an object
produces a question instead of a crash. `audit` reports the question without changing its exit
semantics. `repair` and `overwrite` refuse before writing configuration, and no verb edits the
birth-owned `package.json`.

### Exit codes

`0` means the target matched its plan and every step completed. `1` means the target drifted or a
step failed. `2` means the command line was not a command. A foreign file counts as drift: the
target holds something the plan does not own, whether or not the verb that found it was allowed to
remove it.

### Git

`overwrite` is the only verb that reads git, and it needs a repository. It asks git for the tracked
set and the dirty set, deletes only tracked paths, and refuses a tree carrying uncommitted changes
unless `--dirty` waives that refusal. A target that is not a git repository is refused under
`TARGET`, because deletion there would have no recovery mechanism. The other four verbs never ask.

### Machine-readable output

`--json` replaces the report with one JSON value on standard output. Warnings and refusals go to
standard error, so a piped value is never polluted.

| Verb        | Value                                                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `new`       | `MaterializeResult` — `target`, `written`, `skipped`, `removed`            |
| `audit`     | `Audit` — `findings` and `questions`; planned findings carry `ownership`   |
| `repair`    | `MaterializeResult` plus `audit`, the terminal audit taken after the write |
| `catalog`   | `MaterializeResult` plus `entries`, `mirrors`, and `dropped`               |
| `overwrite` | The `catalog` value plus `audit`, `releases`, and `note` on a partial run  |

Every failure reports the same envelope instead: `{ "error": { "code": …, "message": … } }`. The
code is a `ScaffoldErrorCode`, or `USAGE` for a command line that never became a command, or
`FAILED` for a raised value that published no code of its own. A command line that never became a
command carries no `--json`, so its refusal is always prose.

## Blueprint

A `Blueprint` is the closed, JSON-serializable specification of one workspace. `createBlueprint`
fills every field a caller does not state:

```ts
import { createBlueprint } from '@orkestrel/scaffold'

const blueprint = createBlueprint('router', {
	src: ['core', 'server'],
	dependencies: [{ name: '@orkestrel/emitter', range: '^0.0.5' }],
	bin: true,
})

blueprint.version // '0.0.1'
blueprint.engines // '>=22.12.0'
```

`src` selects published library environments and `app` selects private application environments.
The two axes are independent, so a library-only, an application-only, and a mixed workspace are all
first class. `dependencies` and `peers` are runtime `@orkestrel/*` packages; `extras` are
development dependencies and may carry any valid npm name.

One published environment owns the package root directly. Several published environments require
`core`, which owns that root while each other environment keeps its subpath. A multi-environment
`src` selection without `core` therefore emits entry fields naming a `core` build the workspace
never runs. The gate reports that as a non-blocking `src` question rather than refusing the compile,
because the shape is chosen once and read afterwards: `new` refuses the advisory, while `audit` and
`repair` need the plan to describe and restore a target that already has that shape. A library
caller creating a workspace holds the same refusal, and the Compile section below states it.

`bin`, `guides`, `distribution`, `integration`, `conformance`, `service`, `vendors`, `global`, and
`showcase` are structural facts. Each is set only when the workspace physically ships the directory
or exact-case file that defines it, never because of the workspace's name and never because a
sibling fact is set.

A structural fact is read when a verb runs, not when the file appears. Writing
`tests/integration.test.ts` into a workspace sets the fact, but the root configuration on disk was
generated before that file existed and still registers no `integration` project, so `test:config`
fails with `integration has no project factory or configuration` until a plan-writing verb
regenerates it.

`repair` alone does not close that, and refusing is correct rather than a gap. `package.json` is
birth-owned, so the verb cannot add the project's script, and it will not register a project the
manifest reaches from no gate. It exits 1 naming the target and writes nothing.

Adding a structural proof is therefore three steps, in order: write the file; declare its
`test:<project>` script and invoke that script from a gate chain; then run `repair`, which
regenerates the root configuration and registers the project. `audit` reports whichever piece is
still outstanding at each step.

`distribution` projects only when the workspace also publishes at least one `src` environment. It
packs and installs the published artifact, so without that axis there is nothing to pack, and the
declared flag alone adds no project, no `test:distribution` script, and no gate entry.

`service` says the workspace runs a live-service Vitest project over `tests/service`, and it alone
registers that project, its `test:service` script, and the `tests/setupService.ts` readiness module
the project names. A publishing workspace invokes it from `prepublishOnly`; a `private: true`
workspace invokes it from `test`, which is the only gate it has. Its longer timeouts and disabled
file parallelism are the same in both. `vendors` names each external service the workspace drives
and emits `scripts/service.sh`, the provisioner that starts them. Neither is derivable from the
other: a workspace may declare vendors before it writes a suite, and a suite may drive a service the
skeleton does not start.

`integration` projects a cross-environment composition proof for any workspace, independently of
whether it has a published `src`. Its generated seed imports every selected `src` and `app`
environment through its public barrel. It starts no process and does not pack or install the
workspace. The proof composes across environments, so when `src` and `app` together declare fewer
than two the gate reports a non-blocking `integration` question: the project, the script, and the
`test` entry are all still registered, and the advisory reports that the seed composes nothing
rather than withholding it.

`showcase` projects only when the browser `app` environment exists. Without that axis the flag adds
no artifact, configuration, script, or dependency, and the gate reports a non-blocking question on
that field so the caller who set it learns it emitted nothing.

`createBlueprint` enforces shape only. Whether the name is a name, the version a version, and the
axis combination one this package can generate are the gate's laws, and the gate answers them with
questions. A blueprint the gate will refuse is still constructible, so one law lives in one place.

## Compile

The compiler is pure, synchronous, and host-independent. It runs three stages in order.

| Stage   | Does                                                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `draft` | Assembles the artifacts the selected groups cover, and applies overrides |
| `gate`  | Measures the blueprint, its overrides, and the drafted artifacts         |
| `pin`   | Gives the plan its content identity                                      |

```ts
import { createBlueprint, createCompiler } from '@orkestrel/scaffold'

const compiler = createCompiler()
const scaffolding = compiler.compile(createBlueprint('router', { src: ['core'] }))

scaffolding.plan?.artifacts // every planned file, in group order
scaffolding.stages // one CompileRecord per stage that ran
compiler.destroy()
```

One rule decides the outcome: a `Scaffolding` carries a plan exactly when no question blocks. A
refused blueprint is answered rather than raised, so a caller reads the refusal from the value it
asked for. Each stage records its input and its output, a failed stage records the coded reason
beside them, and the stages after a failed one never run.

A plan says the blueprint can be built. It does not say the blueprint should be created. Every
question beside the plan is advice the compile could not settle, and the caller that chose the shape
is the one that answers it. So `new` refuses on any question, blocking or not, before it writes,
while `audit` and `repair` carry the same questions through, because a target that already has that
shape still has to be described and restored.

A library caller creating a fresh workspace applies `new`'s rule itself:

```ts
import { createBlueprint, createCompiler } from '@orkestrel/scaffold'

const compiler = createCompiler()
const scaffolding = compiler.compile(createBlueprint('router', { src: ['browser', 'server'] }))

scaffolding.plan === undefined || scaffolding.questions.length > 0 // true — do not write this shape
compiler.destroy()
```

`materialize` does not apply that rule for you, and it could not: `compile` returns `questions`
beside `plan`, and the writer receives the plan alone. It refuses what only a writer can see — a
target that is not vacant — and writes the plan it is given otherwise. Choosing a shape is a policy
about which workspace to want, the plan has already answered whether that workspace can be built,
and the questions are where the package says what it thinks of the choice. That is the same line
`createBlueprint` draws when it constructs a blueprint the gate will refuse: one law lives in one
place, and the caller that picked the shape is the one holding it.

Off-contract input is different. A value that is not the exact shape raises `ScaffoldError` coded
`INVALID`, because it is not a question anyone can answer. Both entry points snapshot the caller's
value first and then guard the snapshot, so a property backed by an accessor is refused rather than
read.

Overrides replace a drafted artifact's content whole. The gate checks each override against the
blueprint's full draft before a group selection narrows the returned plan, so an override outside a
selected group does not block that compile. An override that matches no artifact in the full draft,
that targets a host-origin artifact, or that targets the manifest is a blocking question rather
than a silent no-op.

### Groups

A plan selects over seven groups, and a compile that names none covers all of them. The order below
is the order a plan lists its artifacts in.

| Group           | Holds                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `manifest`      | `package.json`                                                     |
| `configs`       | The root and per-target build configuration, and the root dotfiles |
| `source`        | The selected environment barrels and entries                       |
| `tests`         | The shared setup modules, the entry tests, and the policy sweep    |
| `guides`        | The guide index and the vendored guide mirrors                     |
| `docs`          | `README.md` and the root instruction documents                     |
| `orchestration` | The harness directories, the bench scripts, and `.mcp.json`        |

## Ownership and drift

Two axes describe every planned file, and they answer different questions. `Origin` says how the
content is produced. `Ownership` says what scaffold claims at the path.

| `Origin`   | Content comes from                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `host`     | Byte-copied from the vendored data root     |
| `template` | Filled from a frozen template definition    |
| `computed` | Derived by this package's combination logic |

| `Ownership` | Audit compares | A write does                                      |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `content`   | The bytes      | Restore a missing file, replace a stale one       |
| `presence`  | Existence only | Restore an absent file, never touch present bytes |
| `birth`     | Nothing        | Create the file only while it is absent           |

Presence ownership has two separate mechanisms, and a reader needs to know which applies:

| Mechanism       | Paths                                             | Bytes belong to       | Cost                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Verb-owned      | `CATALOG_AGENT_PATH` and dependency guide mirrors | `catalog` or `mirror` | The owning verb is the only route for a later update.   |
| Workspace-owned | `WORKSPACE_OWNED_PATHS`, currently `.gitignore`   | The target workspace  | Present bytes receive no later canonical ignore update. |

Birth ownership is what makes a generated workspace the consumer's. `package.json`, the source
barrels, the tests, `README.md`, and `guides/README.md` are written once and are never rewritten by
a later verb.

Content ownership does not preserve an arbitrary custom Vitest project. Fixed optional proofs are
selected by their defining paths, as `guides`, `distribution`, `integration`, `conformance`, and
`service` are. A workspace that needs other local configuration must keep those edits outside a
content-owned file; `repair` restores that file to the canonical project set.

An audit reports one `Finding` per planned path, followed by any foreign path beneath the groups
the plan covers. Every planned finding carries its artifact's `ownership`. A foreign finding has
no ownership because no artifact was planned for its path. `Ownership` says what scaffold claims at
a path, not what one run did there. Counting planned findings by `content`, `presence`, and `birth`
therefore says what audit is entitled to compare and stays the same against a vacant target and a
repaired one. What one run compared comes from `ownership`, `drift`, and `observed` together. A
content-owned finding carrying `observed` had its bytes compared. A content-owned `missing` finding
and every presence-owned finding were decided by existence alone. A birth-owned finding was not
examined. The foreign findings are exactly the ones no ownership accounts for. The audit stores no
aggregate tally.

The plan and snapshot are each bounded at `MAX_COLLECTION_ITEMS`. An audit may therefore carry one
finding per planned artifact plus one per unplanned snapshot path, up to `MAX_AUDIT_FINDINGS`.

| `Drift`   | Means                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `aligned` | The target matches the plan           |
| `stale`   | The target holds different bytes      |
| `missing` | The target holds no file at that path |
| `foreign` | The plan does not own the path at all |

A stale or foreign finding carries the destination's exact bytes in `observed`, and that record is
the precondition the mutation is held to. A write that replaces stale bytes and a deletion that
removes a foreign file each fail when the destination no longer matches what the finding recorded.
The requirement sits in the type rather than in prose, because a deletion that cannot bind to what
the audit showed is the one thing the destructive verb must never do.

The shape a `Finding` admits is wider than the set an audit produces. Which combinations of
`ownership`, `drift`, and `observed` a real comparison reaches is `inferDrift`'s law — birth is
always aligned, presence compares existence only, and bytes are recorded only where they were
read — so the shape admits a birth-owned path reported stale, which no audit produces. That is
deliberate: restating the comparison's case analysis in the type would be a second copy of it, able
to disagree with the one that decides. `isFinding` proves the shape a reader may destructure and
nothing about whether the verdict is one an audit could have reached. `repair` and `remove`
re-derive every verdict themselves and act only on what they derived, so a verdict the comparison
could not have produced is refused by name rather than acted on.

That shape is versioned, and the guard runs at runtime. `repair` and `remove` guard the whole audit
before reading any of it, so an audit persisted or built against an earlier version of this package
is refused with a coded `INVALID` failure rather than accepted and partly understood. A planned
finding carries `ownership`, which findings made before that field existed do not. `remove` acts
only on foreign findings, which never carried ownership, but the guard reads every finding, so one
older planned finding refuses that call too. Take a fresh audit rather than replaying a stored one:
a stored audit records what a target looked like then, and both verbs bind their writes to what a
target holds now. The refusal is deliberate at `0.0.x` and there is no migration path.

## Fleet catalog

`catalog` rewrites one marker-bounded region in `CATALOG_AGENT_PATH` and nothing else in that file.
The region holds a table with four columns:

| Column                 | Content                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Package`              | The published package name                                                 |
| `Version`              | The registry's `dist-tags.latest`, or the cause when the lookup found none |
| `Layer`                | The publish round the edges place the package in, as `L0`, `L1`, …         |
| `Runtime dependencies` | Each declared runtime edge, as name and range                              |

Both edge-bearing columns come from the same abbreviated packument the version came from, so a
catalog costs one request per package and no more. Only `dependencies` is read. `devDependencies`
reaches no consumer of the published package, so it constrains nothing about publish order, and
reading it would place packages in rounds that do not exist.

The layer is not stored on a row. `catalogToLayers` derives it from the rows' own edges, in the same
call that writes them, so the two cannot disagree:

```ts
import { catalogToLayers } from '@orkestrel/scaffold'

const layers = catalogToLayers(entries)
layers[0] // the names that depend on nothing else in the fleet
```

An edge counts only when it names a package this catalog publishes. An edge leaving the fleet and an
edge to a row that found no version each constrain nothing, so neither holds its dependent back.

The order is load-bearing because these packages are `0.0.x`, where a caret pins one exact release.
A dependent sees a new dependency version only after the dependent re-pins and republishes, so
publishing a dependent before its dependency leaves the dependent pinned to the older release. Two
ranges that disagree install two copies of one package, and the compiler reads those copies as two
distinct types.

A cycle cannot be published in rounds. `catalogToLayers` omits its members rather than placing them
in an order that would be wrong, and their rows carry no layer cell. An absent name is the report:
compare the returned names against the catalog to find one.

## Vendored data root

The vendored data root is the shared file set, staged into the published package as plain data. It
holds the root instruction documents, the licence, the orchestration contract, the four harness
directories, the bench scripts, the shared policy register, the byte-identical root dotfiles, and
the two guide mirrors a generated workspace starts from. `HOST_PATHS` is the candidate list; a plan
carries the subset its target selects, because a workspace never mirrors its own guide.

`stageHost` fills the root from a real checkout at build time:

```ts
import { stageHost } from '@orkestrel/scaffold/server'

stageHost(process.cwd(), 'dist/host') // one ManifestEntry per file staged
```

Each vendored path is copied to a storage name, and every dot that opens a segment comes off,
because npm's own ignore rules would drop a leading-dot entry from the tarball. A dotted file at the
root moves under `dotfiles/` so it cannot collide with an undotted sibling. `manifest.json` is
written last and declares the whole membership: one entry per file, the sorted directory inventory,
and a SHA-256 digest over both. The digest is what detects a membership edit that did not update
it, and the directory inventory is what makes a declared empty directory survive a file walk.

A missing vendored path is refused rather than staged around, and the refusal names every missing
path at once. That is why `guides/scaffold.md` — this file — must exist before `npm run build`
completes.

The `Materializer` reads the root once, at construction, and cross-checks the manifest against the
files actually stored. It defaults to the root inside the installed package, resolved from the
module's own location rather than from the caller's working directory. `--from` points it somewhere
else. A root carrying no manifest at all is read as a raw checkout, and artifact paths map onto it
one to one.

## Generated workspace

A workspace's file set is a function of its two axes plus its structural facts. Nothing is fixed
except the manifest.

- One computed artifact: `package.json`, with the entry points, `exports` map, scripts, and
  development dependencies its selection implies.
- One template artifact per configuration file the selection needs: the root `tsconfig.json` and
  `vite.config.ts`, plus a Vite config and a scoped TypeScript config per selected environment, and
  two more when `bin` is set.
- One template artifact, `configs/browsers.ts`, for a workspace selecting `browser` on either axis.
  It resolves the Chromium the Playwright provider launches, and the root `vite.config.ts` calls it
  once into `browserOptions` and passes that to every `playwright()` provider it configures. The
  precedence is `PLAYWRIGHT_EXECUTABLE_PATH`, `PLAYWRIGHT_WS_ENDPOINT`, `PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL`, the
  managed Playwright Chromium, the container's bundled Chromium, a verified system channel, then the
  platform default. An installed pinned revision returns empty options, so Playwright keeps its own
  launch defaults. A pinned revision that is not installed falls through to a `chromium` alias or a
  sibling `chromium-*` revision under the same browsers directory, because a managed container ships
  one usable build for many Playwright versions. It is its own file rather than a block in the
  vendored `configs/helpers.ts`, which every workspace receives byte-identical while only a browser
  selection declares the `playwright` this module imports.
- One template artifact per source and test file the selection needs: an `index.ts` barrel per
  selected environment, `main.ts` and `index.html` for an application browser, `tests/setup.ts`
  plus the host setup modules the selection reaches, and one entry test per axis project. An
  integration selection also emits a birth-owned `tests/integration.test.ts` seed that imports each
  selected public barrel and records its initial empty exports for the consumer to replace with an
  observable cross-environment flow.
- One template artifact each for `README.md` and `guides/README.md`.
- One host artifact per vendored path the workspace selects. A vendored directory is one planned
  path that expands into the files the data root stores beneath it.

`planToSummary` reports the tally rather than a number written down here:

```ts
import { createBlueprint, createCompiler, planToSummary } from '@orkestrel/scaffold'

const compiler = createCompiler()
const scaffolding = compiler.compile(createBlueprint('router', { src: ['core', 'server'] }))
const summary = scaffolding.plan === undefined ? undefined : planToSummary(scaffolding.plan)

summary?.host // vendored artifacts
summary?.template // filled artifacts
summary?.computed // the manifest
compiler.destroy()
```

## Library

The two entry points split by host. `@orkestrel/scaffold` is host-independent: it compiles, gates,
and compares, and it touches neither the filesystem nor the network.
`@orkestrel/scaffold/server` is Node-only and holds everything that does.

Compare a plan against bytes a caller already read:

```ts
import type { Blueprint, Snapshot } from '@orkestrel/scaffold'
import { createCompiler } from '@orkestrel/scaffold'

declare const blueprint: Blueprint
declare const current: Snapshot

const compiler = createCompiler()
const audit = compiler.audit(blueprint, current)

audit.findings.filter(({ drift }) => drift !== 'aligned')
compiler.destroy()
```

Write a compiled plan into a real directory:

```ts
import type { Plan } from '@orkestrel/scaffold'
import { createMaterializer } from '@orkestrel/scaffold/server'

declare const plan: Plan

const materializer = createMaterializer({ host: './dist/host' })
const result = materializer.materialize(plan, './packages/router')

result.written // every path created
materializer.destroy()
```

`resolveContainedPath` refuses a lexical escape, a physical link out of the root, and a dangling
link whose raw target contains a `..` segment. It returns the lexical join of `root` and `path` — an
absolute path under `root`, which is what its shipped example prints — after checking the namespace,
not an open filesystem handle. Its contract therefore excludes a concurrent rename or link swap
during the check or before the caller finishes using that path. A caller that admits hostile
concurrent namespace mutation needs a handle-bound operation instead.

`resolveRealPath` answers the caller's own text collapsed lexically, then resolved through every link
in what survives that collapse. A `..` the caller wrote cancels the segment before it as text, so
`<root>/hop/..` answers `<root>` even where `hop` links elsewhere, rather than the directory holding
what `hop` points at. The collapse only ever shortens the path, so nothing reaches outside it this
way; the answer is a lexical location resolved through links, not a physical one.

Read the registry and the guide host:

```ts
import { createUpstream } from '@orkestrel/scaffold/server'

const upstream = createUpstream({ registry: { timeout: 5_000 } })
const releases = await upstream.lookup([{ name: '@orkestrel/emitter', range: '^0.0.5' }])

releases.filter((release) => release.lookup === 'found')
upstream.destroy()
```

Every request is unauthenticated, follows no redirect, and is bounded twice: `limit` refuses one
oversized answer and `budget` refuses many small ones. A per-package failure is collected as a
verdict carrying its cause rather than thrown, so one unreachable package never costs the caller the
rest of the answer. The organization package list is the exception, because without it there is no
fleet to report.

Both bounds count decoded bytes, and a version lookup asks the registry for the abbreviated
packument — `dist-tags` and a trimmed version map, rather than the full per-version metadata no
verdict reads. That is the smallest form the registry publishes, and `limit` is capped at
`MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES`, so a package with enough published releases to pass it cannot be looked up at
all. It comes back as a `failed` verdict naming the limit, which is this reader's bound and not a
statement about the package.

A status that carries no representation — a `204` or a `205` — is a `failed` verdict naming the
status, never a `found` answer holding no bytes. A genuinely empty file arrives as a `200` and does
read as found.

Stage and swap a set of files yourself:

```ts
import { WriteTransaction } from '@orkestrel/scaffold/server'

const transaction = new WriteTransaction('./packages/router', ['AGENTS.md'])
try {
	transaction.write('AGENTS.md', '# Agents\n')
	transaction.commit() // ['AGENTS.md']
} finally {
	transaction.discard()
}
```

A transaction owns a private root beside the target on the same volume, so every promotion is a
rename rather than a copy. A failure part way through commit restores every destination it already
promoted and removes every directory it created. No destination ever receives half-written bytes.
It is not a journal: a process killed between two promotions leaves a mixed target.
The transaction binds each directory's location rather than its lifetime, so an ancestor swapped
for another path, a file, a symlink, or nothing is refused, and one deleted and recreated in place
may not be.

Narrow a refusal by its code:

```ts
import { isScaffoldError, ScaffoldError } from '@orkestrel/scaffold'

try {
	throw new ScaffoldError('TARGET', 'The target carries no readable manifest.')
} catch (error) {
	if (isScaffoldError(error)) error.code // 'TARGET'
}
```

`INVALID` is off-contract input, `BLOCKED` is a refused blueprint, `TARGET` is a destination that is
not what the caller's observation said it was, `WRITE` is a mutation that could not be completed, and
`FETCH` is an upstream read that produced no answer.

`BLOCKED` covers both refusals a blueprint can meet, because they are one fact — this blueprint will
not be built — and the questions say which. The compiler answers its refusal rather than throwing it:
the gate fails closed and records `BLOCKED` on its stage, so a caller reads that refusal from the
value it asked for. A verb that creates a workspace throws it, because it chose the shape and has
nothing to hand back. A blocking question closed the gate; a non-blocking one is a shape the package
can describe and declines to create.

Every entity publishes an emitter. The compiler emits `compile`, `audit`, `block`, `error`, and
`destroy`; the materializer emits `write`, `remove`, `finish`, `error`, and `destroy`; the upstream
reader emits `release`, `mirror`, `error`, and `destroy`. Errors are emitted immediately before they
are thrown, so an observer sees a refusal even where the caller catches it.

## Limits

Seven things a reader will look for and not find.

**A code fence in this guide is unverified.** [`tests/guides.test.ts`](../tests/guides.test.ts)
proves that every fence imports only real exports of the two barrels, and that every backticked name
in this file resolves to one. It neither runs a fence nor typechecks one, so a trailing `// value`
comment inside a fence states what this guide claims rather than what the build answered. The
verdicts that are measured are the ones a consumer hovers:
[`tests/distribution.test.ts`](../tests/distribution.test.ts) drives every `@example` the built
declarations print against the installed package, scores each verdict it can read as a value, and
names exactly the ones it cannot. Fences are not added to that instrument, because most of them
cannot be run: several declare an ambient value that has no runtime, and several write to a
directory or read the network, so executing them would be a mutation rather than a check.

**The library does not enforce the creating verb's policy.** `new` refuses a blueprint carrying any
question, and `materialize` writes any plan into any vacant target. A workspace of several published
`src` environments without `core` is therefore constructible, compilable, and writable through the
library, and its manifest names a `core` build the workspace never runs — which is exactly what the
advisory said. The refusal lives in the verb that chose the shape because that verb is the only one
holding the advice: `compile` returns `questions` beside `plan`, and `materialize` receives the plan
alone, so it has nothing to refuse on. The Compile section states the rule a library caller applies
in its place.

**`isPath` does not prove host portability.** It proves bounded target-relative syntax and rejects
traversal, separators, controls, and reserved syntax characters. It deliberately admits host-specific
segment spellings such as a Windows device name, a trailing dot or space, and a segment beyond a
filesystem's byte ceiling. The compiler emits none of those names. A caller-supplied plan may carry
one, and the writer reports the host's refusal rather than treating logical path syntax as a promise
that every filesystem can create it. `isFilesystemPath` is the separate server guard for target and
vendored-root locations on the host. Both `/` and `\` are separators to every reading in this
package, on every host, including the server's reading of a raw symbolic-link target. A POSIX
filename that legally contains a backslash — `weird\..\name` — is therefore refused as three
segments rather than admitted as one name. That is one separator law with a conservative side, not a
host-dependent second one.

**Scaffold emits no styles axis.** `SRC_MATRIX` is exactly `core`, `browser`, and `server`, and
`Blueprint` carries no styles field. A workspace that needs `src/styles/` adds the directory, its
configuration, and its Vitest project by hand. `.claude/rules/workspace.md` describes styles as an
environment because the fleet has one; scaffold simply does not generate it.

**No host path is normalized before it is guarded.** `isFilesystemPath` refuses an empty segment, so
`packages//router` is off contract. A trailing separator does not produce one: it terminates a
directory rather than opening a segment, and every Node path API reads `./packages/router/` and
`./packages/router` as one location, so both are admitted. Every server entry point and the
`--target` option guard the text they were handed and resolve it afterwards, so a directory taken
from a shell completion arrives carrying the separator the shell appended and names the directory it
appears to name.

**A generated workspace has empty barrels and no starter entity.** Every emitted `index.ts` exports
nothing. This is deliberate: a generated sample entity is repeatedly mistaken for real
implementation. What a consumer does first is write the module's `types.ts`, then the
implementation that conforms to it, then export both from the barrel — the order `AGENTS.md` fixes.

**A selected distribution, conformance, or live-service proof is registered, but none is written for
you.** Scaffold registers `conformance` and `service` when their structural facts are set, and
registers `distribution` only when the workspace also publishes `src`. In a publishing workspace,
`distribution` and `service` run from `prepublishOnly` and `conformance` stays in `test`. In a
`private: true` workspace, `distribution` is absent, `service` runs from `test`, and there is no
`prepublishOnly` at all. Scaffold emits no proof into any registered project, because each names
something only the package knows: the behavior its own packed artifact must hold once installed, the
official artifact a conformance check measures against, and the service a live proof drives. A
generated placeholder would read as a proof while measuring nothing, so the file a consumer writes
is the file that selects the project.

A distribution proof carries one contract scaffold does enforce from the outside. The generated
`prepublishOnly` invokes it as `npm run test:distribution -- --mode release`, and a proof that reads
`import.meta.env.MODE === 'release'` must **fail** on an unreachable registry rather than skip. An
ordinary local run may skip that case, because a developer offline is not a defect; a release run
may not, because skipping there passes the publish gate without ever proving the artifact installs.
Scaffold writes no proof, so honouring the flag is the consumer's, and a proof that ignores it
reports green on exactly the runs that matter.

The consequence is one empty-project case per registered proof. A publishing blueprint carrying
`distribution` with no `tests/distribution.test.ts`, or any blueprint carrying `conformance` with no
`tests/conformance.test.ts`, registers a project whose include resolves to nothing, and Vitest exits
non-zero on it. A blueprint carrying `service` gets `tests/setupService.ts` — the root configuration
names that module by path, so an absent one fails the project's load rather than its run — and still
no suite beneath `tests/service`, so `test:service` reports no test files until the consumer writes
the first one. Every case is visible the first time the script runs, which is why none is silent.

None of the three folds into `integration`, which measures a different axis rather than a smaller
one: the workspace's selected environments compose through their public barrels. The generated seed
proves only that those barrels load together and expose the initial empty surfaces; the consumer
replaces it with an observable cross-environment flow. The seed starts no process and does not pack
or install the workspace, so the project stays in `test`. Two fleet packages hold the distinction.
`@orkestrel/ollama` drives a real Ollama daemon through a `service` project, so a real service
answers it and it runs from `prepublishOnly`. `@orkestrel/mcp` measures its server against the
specification's own runner, `@modelcontextprotocol/conformance`, through a `conformance` project. It pins that runner as a development dependency and resolves it out
of `node_modules`, and the server the runner drives is one the fixture starts itself on a loopback
port, so the run drives nothing external and stays in `test`.
